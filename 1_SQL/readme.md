# SQL Practice from Coursera: [[The Structured Query Language (SQL)]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-structured-query-language-sql?specialization=databases-for-data-scientists)

based on Northwinds database

# Practice some SELECT queries
* List all the products in the Northwinds database showing productid, productname, quantity per unit, unitprice, and unitsinstock.

            select productid, productname, quantityperunit, unitprice, unitsinstock
            from products;
  
* For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between, and the YEAR when they were hired.
   
            select concat(firstname,' ', lastname), hiredate, date_part('year', hiredate)
            from employees;

* For all products in the Northwinds database, list the productname, unitprice, unitsinstock,  and the total value of the inventory of that product as “Total Value”.  (HINT:  total value = unitsinstock * unitprice.)
   
            select productname, unitprice, unitsinstock, 
                        (unitprice * unitsinstock) AS "Total Value" 
            from products;

* For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between with a column header “Name”, and the name of the month (spelled out) for each employee’s birthday.  

		select concat(firstname,' ', lastname) as "Name", birthdate, to_char(birthdate, 'month')
		from employees;


# Practice some SELECT queries using the WHERE clause

		select customerid, companyname, country
		from customers
		where Country <> 'USA';


* For all products in the Northwinds database, list the productname, unitprice, unitsinstock,  and the total value of the inventory of that product as “Total Value” for all products with a Total Value greater than $1000.  (HINT:  total value = unitsinstock * unitprice)

		select productname, unitprice, unitsinstock, 
			(unitprice * unitsinstock) AS "Total Value" 
		from products
		where (unitprice * unitsinstock) > 1000;

		select orderid, customerid, shippeddate
		from orders
		where shipcountry = 'Canada' and
		      shippeddate between '1996-12-01' and '1997-01-31';


# Practice some SELECT queries using DATE functions

* List the employeeid, firstname + lastname concatenated as ‘employee’, and the age of the employee  when they were hired.

		SELECT EmployeeID, Firstname || ' ' || Lastname as "employee",
			cast (age(HireDate, BirthDate) as text) AS HIRE_AGE 
		FROM employees;

  		SELECT EmployeeID, concat(Firstname, ' ', Lastname) as "employee",
		 	age(HireDate, BirthDate)::text AS "HIRE_AGE" 
		FROM employees;

* Run a query to calculate your age as of today.

* List the employeeid, firstname + lastname concatenated as ‘employee’, and hire date for all employees hired in 1993
		
		SELECT EmployeeID, Firstname || ' ' || Lastname as "employee", hiredate 
		FROM employees 
		WHERE Date_part('year', hiredate) = 1993; 

# Practice some SELECT queries using GROUP functions and GROUP BY

* List the total (unitprice * quantity) as “Total Value” by orderid for the top 5 orders.  (That is, the five orders with the highest Total Value.)  

		SELECT OrderID,  SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) AS "Total Value"  
		FROM orderdetails 
		GROUP BY OrderID

		SELECT count(orderid) 
		FROM orders 
		WHERE customerid is NULL or
                      customerid NOT IN ( 
				SELECT customerID
	  			FROM customers); 

* Use a subquery in a SELECT to list productname and its totoal values.  

		SELECT productname, ( SELECT SUM(unitprice*quantity)
					from orderdetails O
					where O.productid = P.productid) as Total
		FROM products P; 

* Use a subquery in a FROM to list orderid that have less than 100 quantity. 

		SELECT orderid

			FROM orderdetals
			GROUP BY orderid
			HAVING SUM(quantity) < 100
			) as DetailCount;


# Practice some SELECT queries using inner joins

		FROM shippers S LEFT OUTER JOIN orders O  
			ON S.shipperid = O.shipvia 
		GROUP BY S.shipperid, companyname
		HAVING count(orderid) = 0;

# Create an Tables/Views
* create an “items” table with the following schema:
  
		itemID integer primary key, 
		itemcode varchar(5) null,
		itemname varchar(40) not null default “ “,
		quantity integer not null default 0,
		price decimal (9,2) not null default 0

Solution: 

		CREATE TABLE items  
		(  
		    itemID     INT           primary key, 
		    itemcode   VARCHAR(5)    NULL, 
		    itemname   VARCHAR(40)   NOT NULL DEFAULT ' ', 
		    quantity   INT           NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, 
		    price      DECIMAL(9,2)  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 
		  ); 



* Populate your new table with data from the Products table: 
	Consisting of productid, 
	concat(supplierid, categoryid,discontinued),
	productname, unitsinstock, unitprice

Solution: 

		INSERT INTO items 
			(SELECT productid,  
			concat(supplierid, categoryid,discontinued),  
				productname, unitsinstock, unitprice  
			from products); 

* Verify that your table was created and populated successfully

		Select * from items



#  Alter operations

* Change the name of the ‘items’ table to ‘demo’  

		ALTER TABLE items
			RENAME TO "demo";

* Change the name of the ‘itemcode’ column to ‘itemclass’  

		ALTER TABLE demo
			RENAME COLUMN "itemcode" TO "itemclass";

* Add a new column ‘iteminfo’ to your ‘demo’ table  

		ALTER TABLE demo
			ADD COLUMN "iteminfo" VARCHAR(5) NULL;

* Add some data to your new column, copying the values from the itemclass column

		UPDATE demo
			SET "iteminfo" = "itemclass";	

* Take another look at your ALTERed table 

		Select * from demo
