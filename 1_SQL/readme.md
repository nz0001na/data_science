# SQL Practice from Coursera: [[The Structured Query Language (SQL)]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-structured-query-language-sql?specialization=databases-for-data-scientists)


# Practice some SELECT queries: based on Northwinds database
## List all the products in the Northwinds database showing productid, productname, quantity per unit, unitprice, and unitsinstock.
  
## For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between, and the YEAR when they were hired.  

## For all products in the Northwinds database, list the productname, unitprice, unitsinstock,  and the total value of the inventory of that product as “Total Value”.  (HINT:  total value = unitsinstock * unitprice.) 

## For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between with a column header “Name”, and the name of the month (spelled out) for each employee’s birthday.
