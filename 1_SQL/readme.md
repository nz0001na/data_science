based on Northwinds database

# Practice some SELECT queries

            select productid, productname, quantityperunit, unitprice, unitsinstock
            from products;
  
* For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between, and the YEAR when they were hired.
   
            select concat(firstname,' ', lastname), hiredate, date_part('year', hiredate)
            from employees;

* For all products in the Northwinds database, list the productname, unitprice, unitsinstock,  and the total value of the inventory of that product as “Total Value”.  (HINT:  total value = unitsinstock * unitprice.)
   
            select productname, unitprice, unitsinstock, 
                        (unitprice * unitsinstock) AS "Total Value" 
            from products;

* For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between with a column header “Name”, and the name of the month (spelled out) for each employee’s birthday.  

		select concat(firstname,' ', lastname) as "Name", birthdate, to_char(birthdate, 'month')

		      shippeddate between '1996-12-01' and '1997-01-31';


# Practice some SELECT queries using DATE functions

* List the employeeid, firstname + lastname concatenated as ‘employee’, and the age of the employee  when they were hired.

		SELECT EmployeeID, Firstname || ' ' || Lastname as "employee",
			cast (age(HireDate, BirthDate) as text) AS HIRE_AGE

# Create an Tables/Views
* create an “items” table with the following schema:
  
		itemID integer primary key, 
		itemcode varchar(5) null,
		itemname varchar(40) not null default “ “,
		quantity integer not null default 0,
		price decimal (9,2) not null default 0

Solution: 

		CREATE TABLE items  
		(  
		    itemID     INT           primary key, 
		    itemcode   VARCHAR(5)    NULL, 
		    itemname   VARCHAR(40)   NOT NULL DEFAULT ' ', 
		    quantity   INT           NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, 
		    price      DECIMAL(9,2)  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 
		  ); 



* Populate your new table with data from the Products table: 
	Consisting of productid, 
	concat(supplierid, categoryid,discontinued),
	productname, unitsinstock, unitprice

Solution: 

		INSERT INTO items 
			(SELECT productid,  
			concat(supplierid, categoryid,discontinued),  
				productname, unitsinstock, unitprice  
			from products); 

* Verify that your table was created and populated successfully

		Select * from items



#  Alter operations

* Change the name of the ‘items’ table to ‘demo’  

		ALTER TABLE items
			RENAME TO "demo";

* Change the name of the ‘itemcode’ column to ‘itemclass’  

		ALTER TABLE demo
			RENAME COLUMN "itemcode" TO "itemclass";

* Add a new column ‘iteminfo’ to your ‘demo’ table  

		ALTER TABLE demo
			ADD COLUMN "iteminfo" VARCHAR(5) NULL;

* Add some data to your new column, copying the values from the itemclass column

		UPDATE demo
			SET "iteminfo" = "itemclass";	

* Take another look at your ALTERed table 

		Select * from demo


# Add/Update/Drop/Truncate Operations

* Insert a new row of data into your "demo" table using format # 1 of the INSERT.  Include these values:
		VALUES
		    (101,'1234','Spicy Grillmate', 12, 1.99, '1234');

Solution:

		INSERT INTO demo
		    		(itemid, itemclass, itemname, quantity, price, iteminfo)
		 	VALUES 
		  		(101,'1234','Spicy Grillmate', 12, 1.99, '1234');

* Insert a new row of data into your "demo" table using format # 2 of the INSERT.  Include these values:

		VALUES
		    (102,'6789','GlobalWarmer', 24, 42.99, '6789');

Solution:
		
		INSERT INTO demo
		    	  VALUES 
		  		(102,'6789','GlobalWarmer', 24, 42.99, '6789');
    
* Update the iteminfo column to ‘0000’ for rows where the itemid is greater than 100

		UPDATE demo
			SET "iteminfo" = '0000'
			WHERE itemid > 100;	

* Delete the rows you just added  to the “demo” table

		DELETE FROM demo
				WHERE itemid > 100;

* Drop the “demo” table  

		DROP TABLE demo

# Use a View
* Create a "TopCustomers" view  using the following SELECT statement to populate the view.

  		SELECT companyname, sum(unitprice * quantity) as "Total Sales"
		from customers C JOIN
		    orders O ON C.customerid  =  O.customerid JOIN
		          orderdetails D ON O.orderid  =  D.orderid
		GROUP BY companyname 
		Order By 2 desc LIMIT 5;

Solution:
		create view topcustomers as 
		SELECT companyname, sum(unitprice * quantity) as "Total Sales"
		  from customers C JOIN
		    orders O ON C.customerid  =  O.customerid JOIN 
		          orderdetails D ON O.orderid  =  D.orderid
		GROUP BY companyname 
		Order By 2 desc LIMIT 5;


* Run a Query Against Your View to ensure that it works

		Select * from topcustomers

# CASE statement

* Let’s drop and recreate your view topcustomers, adding a CASE expression.  Add a third column to your view called “Assessment”.

    Set the Assessment column equal to “Needs Focus” if the customer’s total sales is less than $60,000

    Set the Assessment column equal to “Average” if the customer’s total sales is greater than or equal to $60,000 but less than $115,000.

    Otherwise set the Assessment column equal to “Outstanding” if the customer’s total sales is greater than or equal to $115,000.


		DROP VIEW TopCustomers;
		
		create view TopCustomers as 
		SELECT companyname, sum(unitprice * quantity) as "Total Sales",
		  CASE  
		        WHEN sum(unitprice * quantity) < 60000 THEN 'NeedsFocus'
		        WHEN sum(unitprice * quantity) < 110000 THEN 'Average'
		        ELSE 'Outstanding'
		  END  Assessment
		FROM customers C JOIN
		    orders O ON C.customerid  =  O.customerid JOIN 
		          orderdetails D ON O.orderid  =  D.orderid
		GROUP BY companyname 
		Order By 2 desc LIMIT 5;

* Run a Query Against Your View to see the CASE results
  
		SELECT * FROM TopCustomers

* Query DML/DDL Problems Using the Classic Models database

1.  Create a NEW table named “TopCustomers” with three columns: CustomerNumber (integer), ContactDate (DATE) and  OrderTotal (a real number.)  None of these columns can be NULL.  

		create table if not exists TopCustomers ( 
			Customernumber int not null,

		);

2.  Populate the new table “TopCustomers” with the CustomerNumber, today’s date, and the total value of all their orders (PriceEach * quantityOrdered) for those customers whose order total value is greater than $140,000. (should insert 10 rows )

		insert into TopCustomers 
		select c.customernumber, CURRENT_date, SUM(priceEach * Quantityordered) 
   		from Customers c, Orders o, OrderDetails d  	 	
   		where c.Customernumber = o.Customernumber  
   			and o.Ordernumber = d.Ordernumber 
		group by c.Customernumber 
		having SUM(priceEach * Quantityordered) > 140000;


		insert into TopCustomers 
		select c.customernumber, CURRENT_date, SUM(priceEach * Quantityordered)

		having SUM(priceEach * Quantityordered) > 140000;

3.  List the contents of the TopCustomers table in descending OrderTotal sequence. (10) 

		select * from topcustomers order by 3 desc; 

4.  Add a new column to the TopCustomers table called OrderCount (integer).

		alter table topcustomers 
		add column OrderCount integer ; 

5.  Update the Top Customers table, setting the OrderCount to a random number between 1 and 10.  Hint:  use (RANDOM() *10)

		update topcustomers 
		set ordercount = random()*10);

6.  List the contents of the TopCustomers table in descending OrderCount sequence. (10 rows)

		select * 
		from topcustomers 
		order by 4 desc;

7.  Drop the TopCustomers table. (no answer set)  

		Drop table topcustomers;
