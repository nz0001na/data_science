# Practice some SELECT queries: based on Northwinds database
1. List all the products in the Northwinds database showing productid, productname, quantity per unit, unitprice, and unitsinstock.

            select productid, productname, quantityperunit, unitprice, unitsinstock
            from products;
  
2. For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between, and the YEAR when they were hired.  

3. For all products in the Northwinds database, list the productname, unitprice, unitsinstock,  and the total value of the inventory of that product as “Total Value”.  (HINT:  total value = unitsinstock * unitprice.) 

4. For all employees at Northwinds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between with a column header “Name”, and the name of the month (spelled out) for each employee’s birthday.
